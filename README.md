### Hey, I'm Wolgrand Lordão! ✌

I´m a brazilian production engineer passionate about project management and development. For me coding is like woodwork in the past it´s the way to make my ideas get life.

I´m a fullstack developer, with 2 years of experience, if you don´t know what it is, I´m capable to build a web or mobile app as well as the back-end utilizing the stack NodeJS/Typescript & ReactJS & React Native.

I want to make this world a little better through design & code. ✨😍

> "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works." - Steve Jobs

I'm always trying to grow and learn something new. I lose track of time when I´m trying to solve a problem with code.

### What I'm focusing on 👨‍💻

Currently improving my React skills: UI Design.<br />
Currently improving my Typescript skills: Database relations.<br />
